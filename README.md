# What Is Internationalization?
## Internationalization describes the process of designing products to meet the needs of users in many countries or designing them so they can be easily modified, to achieve this goal.Internationalization might mean designing a website so that when it's translated from English to Spanish, the aesthetic layout still works properly. This may be difficult to achieve because many words in Spanish have more characters than their English counterparts. They may thus take up more space on the page in Spanish than in English.
